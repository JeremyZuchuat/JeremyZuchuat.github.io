			  	<h1> What Drives the Decline in Job Offers?</h1>
					<h2>joint with Rafael Lalive (UNIL), Aderonke Osikominu (Hohenheim), Lorenzo Pesaresi (UZH) & Josef Zweimüller (UZH) </h2>
					<p>
						Studying the duration dependence phenomenon in the labor market, i.e. the effect of elapsed unemployment duration on job finding. </br>
						Analysing duration's effect on job seekers' (e.g. workers' discouragement) and firms' (e.g. discrimination towards long-term unemployed) behaviors, accounting for dynamic selection.
					<!--
					Job finding is a complex process involving sequential decisions taken by job seekers and firms.
    				The decline in job finding chances over the course of unemployment is well established, but we still know little about those intermediary decisions' dynamics.
    				We use longitudinal monthly data from job search diaries for several thousand job seekers, which record all applications they send, along with employer callbacks and job offers.
    				Accounting for heterogeneity, we document a net decline in the number of applications and chances of a callback over time, whereas the chances of receiving a job offer after being interviewed are found to be slightly increasing.
    				Individual heterogeneity is found to play a role mostly before the interview stage.
    				Our empirical findings are rationalized in a job search model with statistical discrimination.
    				Firms use elapsed unemployment duration as a signal of applicants' productivity when making callbacks decisions and make job offer decisions based on new information revealed during the job interview.
    				As duration negatively impacts job seekers' chances of getting a job, those react endogenously by lowering their search effort over time.

			  	<h1> Commuting Decisions in Fiscally Decentralized Economies</h1>
					<h2>joint with Nicola Mauri (University of Lausanne, Swiss Federal Tax Administration) </h2>
					<p> 
						Studying the trade-offs faced by workers in fiscally decentralized areas bewteen local (income) taxes, commuting costs and housing prices. </br>
						Analysing the effects of these location factors on income segregation.
						<!--Decentralized taxation affects numerous dimensions of economic activity, but how it shapes individual commuting decisions and spatial income sorting is still not well understood. We develop a structural model of individual location choices in a fiscally decentralized monocentric city with explicit commuting costs. Income sorting arises from non-homothetic housing preferences combined with decentralized progressive income taxes, which affect the willingness to commute of high-income individuals more than that of low incomes. This induces high incomes to be more willing to commute to low-tax jurisdictions. We estimate this model using micro-level data on moving decisions in Switzerland. Based on a random utility framework, we find that lower local taxes directly increase individuals’ willingness to commute and that high incomes are less sensitive to commuting. In a counterfactual exercise, we show that uniform taxation within urban areas would lead to more high-income individuals locating in central jurisdictions, hence enduring lower commutes.-->

					<h1> How Vacancy Referrals affect Job Search: Evidence from Job Applications Data</h1>
					<h2>single-authored paper</h2>
					<p>
						Evaluating the effects of vacancy referrals (by caseworkers at Publics Employment Centers) on job search outcomes. </br>
						Use of granular applications data to analyze the effects of the policy on job seekers search effort, firms' responses to applications and the characteristics of the jobs that are targeted. 
					</p>
						<!-- Job vacancy referrals by caseworkers represent an effective and widely-used job search assistance tool at public employment service. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which they affect job finding. This paper uses granular job applications data with firms’ responses to shed light on how this policy impacts job search. Exploiting data at the application-level, we find that applications following referrals have a higher chance of leading to a callback or job offer, controlling for individual-by-unemployment duration fixed effects. This effect is partially driven by referred vacancies exhibiting different and lower-paying characteristics. We further study referrals effects on individual-monthly-level outcomes using caseworker stringency as an instrument. Our results show that job seekers apply to fewer positions by themselves in months when they get referred, whereas their total number of applications, including referred applications, increases significantly. These positive effects eventually translate into a large increase in the monthly number of job interviews and job offers obtained by job seekers.</p>-->

					<h1> Estimating Duration Dependence in Job Search: the Within-Estimation Duration Bias</h1>
					<h2>single-authored paper</h2>
					<p>
						Demonstrating the existence of a (duration) bias when (net) duration dependence effects are estimated through fixed effects models, a commonly used approach when dynamic selection affects the sample of study.
					</p>
					<!--<p> Many recent studies use individual longitudinal data to analyze job search behaviors. Such data allow for the use of fixed effects models, which supposedly address the issue of dynamic selection and make the identification of the structural effect of time possible. However, using fixed effects can induce a sizable within-estimation bias if job search outcomes take specific values at the time job seekers leave unemployment. This pattern entails undesirable mechanical correlation between the error term and the time regressor. This paper derives the condition under which the fixed effects estimator provides valid estimates of structural duration dependence relationships. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that the extent of the bias can be extremely large. Our results are not limited to the sole job search context, but naturally extend to any framework where longitudinal data are used to measure the structural effect of time.</p>-->
