			  	<h1> How job seekers and firms’ behaviors shape duration dependence in job finding</h1>
					<h2>joint with Rafael Lalive, Aderonke Osikominu & Josef Zweimüller </h2>
					<p>
						Job finding is a complex process involving sequential decisions taken by job seekers and firms.
    				The decline in job finding chances over the course of unemployment is well established, but we still know little about those intermediary decisions' dynamics.
    				We use longitudinal monthly data from job search diaries for several thousand job seekers, which record all applications they send, along with employer callbacks and job offers.
    				Accounting for heterogeneity, we document a net decline in the number of applications and chances of a callback over time, whereas the chances of receiving a job offer after being interviewed are found to be slightly increasing.
    				Individual heterogeneity is found to play a role mostly before the interview stage.
    				Our empirical findings are rationalized in a job search model with statistical discrimination.
    				Firms use elapsed unemployment duration as a signal of applicants' productivity when making callbacks decisions and make job offer decisions based on new information revealed during the job interview.
    				As duration negatively impacts job seekers' chances of getting a job, those react endogenously by lowering their search effort over time.

			  	<h1> Commuting Decisions in Fiscally Decentralized Economies</h1>
					<h2>joint with Nicola Mauri </h2>
					<p> Delegation of revenue raising responsibilities to regional and local governments is one of the central features of federalist countries. Its effects on on housing prices are well under- stood. But how does fiscal decentralization, and in particular local income taxation, shape commuting decisions of individuals with different income levels? In this paper we develop a structural location choice model where income sorting is generated through housing prices and decentralized progressive income taxation. Additionally, we assume that agents choose their residential location within a monocentric city and incur a commuting disutility according to the travel distance. Our model shows that progressive taxation coupled with decentralization impacts the opportunity cost of time of agents and can make people with higher income more willing to commute to low-tax jurisdictions than low-income earners. These predictions are verified using micro-level data on moving decisions in Switzerland. Based on a random utility approach, we find that high incomes tend to be less sensitive to commuting, and that lower local taxes increase the willingness to commute of individuals. We show that unifying taxes across space would lead to a gentrification of city centers and a decline in the income levels of peripheral jurisdictions.</p>

					<h1> Measuring Duration Dependence using Longitudinal Data: Within-Estimation Duration Bias</h1>
					<p> Recent developments in the empirical labor economics literature has made use of innovative in- dividual longitudinal data to study job search dynamics and the so-called duration dependence phe- nomenon. Such data are supposed to enable researchers to adequately and easily control for (time- constant) unobserved characteristics, a potential severe source of dynamic selection, through the use of simple fixed effects models. However, the within-transformation that is at the core of this esti- mation process might generate undesirable mechanical correlation between the error term and the independent variable of interest, i.e. the time dimension itself. In this paper, we derive the condition under which the within-estimator can be applied to validly estimate duration dependence relation- ships. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that the extent of the so-called within-estimation duration bias can be extremely large. Those results naturally extend to any study context where longitudinal data are used to measure duration dependence relationships.</p>
